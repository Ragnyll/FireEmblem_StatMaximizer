# Fire Emblem Path of Radiance Stat Maximizer #
-----------------------------------------------
### Summary: ###
This application will recommend to you how to maximize a given stat for a
character in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance. This is useful because:

- Numbers are fun to screw with in games like this
- Making the most op character possible is awesome
- Transferring save data into Radiant Dawn is benefitted by managing stat growths.
- Figuring out how to manipulate growth rates is super convoluted.

Needless to say a tool to figure out how to create the perfect monsters at level 20
is cool. This wont give you the exact path on what do, but should give you some
good heuristics to follow.
